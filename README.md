## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue**: CUDA Out of Memory
```python
# Solution: Reduce batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 256  # Instead of 576
```

**Issue**: CLIP not installed
```python
# Solution A: Install it
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git

# Solution B: Disable it
load_dataset_from_folder(..., use_semantic=False)
```

**Issue**: Slow processing
```python
# Solution: More parallel workers
load_dataset_from_folder(..., n_jobs=8)
```
