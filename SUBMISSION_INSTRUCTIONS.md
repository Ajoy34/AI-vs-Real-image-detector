## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: LaTeX won't compile
**Solution:**
- Use Overleaf (easiest, no installation needed)
- Ensure you have `llncs.cls` Springer class file (download from: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)
- Copy `llncs.cls` to same directory as `.tex` file

### Problem: Similarity index too high
**Solution:**
1. Focus on reducing direct quotes
2. Rewrite methodology in your own words
3. Ensure all citations use proper LaTeX format: `\cite{author2023}`
4. Add more original analysis and discussion

### Problem: PDF too large
**Solution:**
```bash
# Compress PDF using Ghostscript
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress \
   -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH \
   -sOutputFile=compressed.pdf IDAA_2025_Paper_Draft.pdf
```

### Problem: Missed deadline
**Solution:**
- Check if there's a late submission option (sometimes available with fee)
- Contact organizing chair: zahid.cse@diu.edu.bd
- Consider submitting to journal version if conference deadline passed
